yippee!!!
tools I will need
-react framework and react bootstrap for mobile and desktop views
-postgres for use as a database to store listings and pipeline info
-express to send between server and frontend
-I dont believe I need any state management like zustand or react redux as the user shouldnt have to interact too hard with the site yet

alright I got a hello world up and running and it's connected to a database if I need that lol.
Now I just need to... design the website lol
